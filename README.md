Kepler Data CSV to JavaScript Object Converter
This project converts the kepler_data.csv file into a JavaScript object using Node.js. It provides a simple way to transform exoplanet data from the Nasa Kepler mission into a more accessible JavaScript format for further analysis or visualization.

Overview
The application reads the Kepler exoplanet dataset from a CSV file and converts it into a structured JavaScript object. This makes the astronomical data easier to work with in JavaScript applications, web visualizations, or data analysis projects. Using the data 8 planets which may contain life are generated.
